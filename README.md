COMPASS MCP Solver
==================

COMPASS is a globally convergent algorithm for solving the Mixed
Complementarity Problem (MCP) implemented in MATLAB version R2011a. The
mathematical theory behind it is based on the PATH solver, the standard
solver for complementarity problems. COMPASS is published under the
GNU General Public License and hence is free software.

COMPASS is an algorithm to solve the mixed complementarity problem
(MCP):

    given  f: R^n -> R^n, and (possibly infinite) bounds l, u
    find   z in [l,u], w,v in R_+^n
    s.t.:  f(z) = w-v
           <(z-l),w> = 0
           <(u-z),v> = 0


The MCP in the box constrained formulation (objective function and boundaries)
and the Jacobian of the objective function must be provided in a file
based interface by the user.

COMPASS is an implementation of a stabilized Newton method. The MCP is
reformulated as the problem of finding a zero of a generally nonsmooth
function (normal map, or normal equation), a general first order
approximation of which is computed at the current iterate. Finding a
zero of this approximation turns out to be a linear MCP, which is solved
with the help of a pivot technique, similar to the one described by
Lemke. This pivot algorithm yields a piecewise linear path connecting
the current point and the zero of the approximation.  Whether the
endpoint of this path is accepted as the next iterate, depends on the
non-monotone stabilization (NMS) - scheme, which employs a watchdog
technique: the algorithm is embedded in a general descent framework,
which uses a smooth merit function, and, depending on it, non-monotone
descent criteria. These criteria are not checked in every step, which
reduces the number of function and gradient evaluations. If the solution
to the linear MCP is checked and not accepted, the generated path is
searched for an acceptable point. If no satisfying point can be found,
a projected gradient step is used.

The algorithm terminates successfully when the zero of the merit function
has been found; this point corresponds to the zero of the normal map,
as well as to a solution of the MCP.
